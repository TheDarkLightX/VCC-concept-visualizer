# Virtuous Cycle Compounder (VCC) Concept Visualizer

An interactive educational website explaining the Virtuous Cycle Compounder (VCC) concept with dynamic visualizations, mathematical formulas, and detailed explanations.

## Features

- **Interactive VCC Visualization**: Explore how the three key mechanisms of VCC work through adjustable parameters and dynamic charts.
- **TEEC Foundation Explainer**: Learn about the TauNet Ethical-Eco Compounder system that forms the foundation of VCC.
- **Mathematical Visualizations**: See formulas and equations in LaTeX-like notation for better understanding.
- **Evolution Diagram**: Visual representation of how TEEC evolves into VCC through enhanced mechanisms and feedback loops.
- **Mathematical Symbol Tooltips**: Hover over mathematical symbols to get explanations of their meaning and significance.

## Key Concepts Explained

1. **Dynamic Base Reward (DBR)**: Visualize how network-wide ethical behavior affects rewards.
2. **Hyper-Compounding Rewards (HCR)**: See how compounding rates increase based on individual ethical behavior.
3. **Aggressive Ethical Burn (AEB)**: Understand deflationary mechanisms based on collective ethical metrics.

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Chart.js for interactive data visualizations
- TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI for responsive design
- Custom SVG diagrams for concept illustrations
